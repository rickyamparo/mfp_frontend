My Favorite places is a location tracking app that can predict your future locations based on trends gleamed through data analysis. This project is the capstone project for [Ricky Ace Amparo](https://github.com/rickyamparo). This is the final project for the curriculum at [The Turing School of Software and Design](https://www.turing.io/). The goal of this project was to use unfamiliar technology and to implement it in a timely fashion. I decided to use React Native for my front end as a way to start learning about mobile development, specifically android development.
